/// sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name,
/// multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.

/// For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth:
/// 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score
/// of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
/// What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
