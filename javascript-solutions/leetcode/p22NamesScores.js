/**
 * # Problem 22 - Names Scores
 * Using `names.txt`, a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by
 * sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name,
 * multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.
 * For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth:
 * 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score
 * of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
 * What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
